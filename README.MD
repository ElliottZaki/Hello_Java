# Project Title: Hello Java

## Motivation: 
In this project I will build a basic 'Hello world' programme. <br />

## Notes:
In Java, all the code is written within classes. Our program needs to have at least one class â€” the main class, here called Hello.<br />
This class name doesn't matter, but it needs to implement a main method similar to the one I created. This is the "entrypoint" of the code when the program starts.<br />

javac Hello.java - compiles the file. <br />
java Hello.java - runs the file. <br />

In a language like Ruby, the code is read and interpreted by the Ruby interpreter (the ruby program) and executed at the same time.<br />

In Java, however, a Java file needs first to be compiled to an executable program. You will notice the presence of a file called Hello.class after calling javac earlier. This new file is the compiled version of our Java source file. <br />
